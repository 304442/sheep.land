Generate a PocketBase import JSON string based on the provided template and data.
The output must be a single, pure, valid JSON string with no comments or other text.

**JSON TEMPLATE (do not modify this template structure):**
```json
[{"id":"[your_c1_id_placeholder]","name":"[YOUR_COLLECTION_1_NAME]","type":"base","system":false,"listRule":"","viewRule":"","createRule":"","updateRule":"","deleteRule":"","options":{},"fields":[{"id":"[c1f1_id]","name":"[c1f1_name]","type":"[c1f1_type]","system":false,"required":[c1f1_required],"unique":[c1f1_unique],"presentable":[c1f1_presentable],"options":[c1f1_options_json],"maxSelect":[c1f1_maxSelect_if_select],"values":[c1f1_values_if_select_json]},{"id":"[c1f2_id]","name":"[c1f2_name]","type":"[c1f2_type]","system":false,"required":[c1f2_required],"unique":[c1f2_unique],"presentable":[c1f2_presentable],"options":[c1f2_options_json],"maxSelect":[c1f2_maxSelect_if_select],"values":[c1f2_values_if_select_json]}]},{"id":"[your_c2_id_placeholder]","name":"[YOUR_COLLECTION_2_NAME]","type":"base","system":false,"listRule":"","viewRule":"","createRule":"","updateRule":"","deleteRule":"","options":{},"fields":[{"id":"[c2f1_id]","name":"[c2f1_name]","type":"[c2f1_type]","system":false,"required":[c2f1_required],"unique":[c2f1_unique],"presentable":[c2f1_presentable],"options":[c2f1_options_json],"maxSelect":[c2f1_maxSelect_if_select],"values":[c2f1_values_if_select_json]}]}]

A. General Guidelines for PocketBase Schema JSON:
The top-level structure is a JSON array of collection definition objects.
Each collection object has "name", "type": "base", "system": false.
API rules (listRule, viewRule, createRule, updateRule, deleteRule) should initially be "" (public).
Each collection has an empty "options": {} object.
Field definitions are in an array.
Each field object has "name", "type", and type-specific "options": {}.
required, unique, presentable are boolean properties of the field object.
Standard system fields (id, created, updated) for records should NOT be explicitly defined in the user-provided field list; PocketBase will add these.
Unique indexes are derived from unique: true flags; do NOT include an indexes: [] array with SQL.
The output must be pure, valid JSON with no comments.
B. Specific Import Preferences for My Target PocketBase Instance:
(These override or clarify the general guidelines above if there's a conflict, based on what has worked for my instance, which is v0.22.1)
Field Definition Array Name: The array for field definitions MUST be named "fields": [...] (not "schema": [...]).
Collection id Attribute: Each collection definition object MUST include a placeholder "id" attribute (e.g., "id": "mycollection_id_placeholder").
Field id Attributes: Each custom field object within a collection's "fields" array MUST include a unique placeholder "id" attribute (e.g., "id": "prefix_f_myfieldname").
select Field Type Structure: For fields of type select, the maxSelect (e.g., 1) and values (an array of strings) properties MUST be direct attributes of the field object itself, not nested within its options object.
system Flag for Custom Fields: All custom fields defined in the "fields" array MUST have "system": false.
C. Collections to Define:
1. Collection Name: [YOUR_COLLECTION_1_NAME]
* Collection ID placeholder: [your_c1_id_placeholder]
* Fields:
* (Field ID: [c1f1_id]) [field1_name]: type [type], required: [true/false], unique: [true/false], presentable: [true/false]. Options: {[option_key]: [option_value]}. (Remember system: false for this custom field, and specific select structure if applicable).
* (Field ID: [c1f2_id]) [field2_name]: type [type], ...
* ...
2. Collection Name: [YOUR_COLLECTION_2_NAME]
* Collection ID placeholder: [your_c2_id_placeholder]
* Fields:
* (Field ID: [c2f1_id]) [field1_name]: type [type], ...
* ...
(Add more collection definitions as needed, ensuring each field adheres to the preferences in Section B, especially the system: false flag for custom fields and the select field structure.)"
