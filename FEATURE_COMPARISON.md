## Summary

The archive_admin folder contains extremely comprehensive and feature-rich applications that far exceed what's currently implemented in the main app modals. The feasibility calculator in archive has 10+ major sections with hundreds of input fields and advanced calculations, while the main app has only basic inputs. The farm management system in archive has complete CRUD operations for all aspects of farm management, while the main app only shows basic stats and a sheep list.

To match the archive functionality, the main app would need significant expansion of both the feasibility calculator and farm management modals, including:
- All the detailed input sections
- Advanced calculations and algorithms
- Charts and visualizations
- Data persistence
- Import/export capabilities
- Report generation
- Multi-language support for all new features
