# PocketBase Migrations Directory

This directory contains database migrations that are automatically executed by PocketBase.

## How it works with your deployment:

1. Your deployment script checks for migrations: `pb_migrations/*.js`
2. If found, it runs: `pocketbase migrate up`
3. Migrations are tracked and run only once

## To add future migrations:

Create new migration files like:
- `1704067200_add_new_field.js`
- `1704153600_update_products.js`

Use Unix timestamp prefix for ordering.
